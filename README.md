  <strong>Scholium: Your Personal Research Agent</strong>
</h1>

Researchers spend days finding relevant papers because Google returns non-credible and unscholarly sources without citations. Scholium is an AI agent that finds and cites the relevant scholarly papers in seconds.

# 🔎Find sources based on a query🔎
Don't search for papers by hand! Find them with just a query!

# 🔮Future plans🔮
- Expanded Context: Currently, Scholium only has access to the arXiv database, but we hope to expand to Pubmed and hopefully academic journals soon!
- More Citation Styles: Let us know what styles you would like us to add!
- Bibliography Manager: Managing a Bibliography can be a pain in the ass. Let us do it so you can save your time. 
- Community Forums: It's like Goodreads for papers! Rate, discuss, and share the most illuminating articles you've come across.
